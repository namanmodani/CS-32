# Lecture Slides

While I've always been a Smallberg fan, I have to admit Carey's slides are incredible. I'd recommend checking out his [website](http://careynachenberg.weebly.com/cs-slides.html) for the most up-to-date self-review slides in the `.pptx` format. Make sure to view them in presentation mode for animations!
