Problem 2

The first 12 (r,c) coordinates popped off the stack by the mazestack algorithm are:
(4,6)
(3,6)
(5,6)
(5,7)
(5,8)
(6,8)
(7,8)
(8,8)
(8,7)
(6,6)
(4,5)
(4,4)

Problem 4

The first 12 (r,c) coordinates popped off the stack by the mazequeue algorithm are:
(4,6)
(4,5)
(5,6)
(3,6)
(4,4)
(6,6)
(5,7)
(4,3)
(5,4)
(5,8)
(4,2)
(6,4)

The algorithms differ in the sense that mazestack implements a stack to perform the search algorithm. This means that
the last coordinate that get pushed into the stack is the first one to get popped off. The stack explores northern
branches first and then continues clockwise. This is also a depth-first search, since each path is searched/mapped to
the end before backtracking and following other potential paths.

Meanwhile, mazequeue implements a queue to perform the search algorithm, i.e. the first coordinate on the queue
is the first coordinate to get popped off. The queue explores western branches first and continues counter-clockwise.
This is a breadth-first search, implying that every possible concurrent path is branched out as they diverge until the
end coordinate is found.
