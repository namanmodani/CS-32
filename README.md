# CS 32: Introduction to Computer Science II

This repository contains my work and course material for CS 32, taken under Professor [David A. Smallberg](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/david-smallberg/) in Winter 2022. The class is based on Frank M. Carrano's "Data Abstraction and Problem Solving with C++: Walls and Mirrors" (7th Edition). 

Software used: C++.

## Course Material
- Data Abstraction
- Pointers and Dynamic Arrays
- Resource Management
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Recursion
- Templates and STL
- Sorting
- Trees
- Tables 
    - Tree-based Tables
    - Hash Tables
- Heaps
- Graphs

CS 32's winter 2022 iteration comprised of four projects, the content of which can be found in `Projects/`. The last two projects being fairly large resulted in my decision to break off my monorepo-style approach for this class. In the interest of clean divison and independent scaling, the code for project 3 can be found [here](https://github.com/namanmodani/SuperPeachSisters), while the code for project 4 can be found [here](https://github.com/namanmodani/Unhinged). In chronological order:

1. [Gone with the Wind](/Projects/Project%201/)
2. [Double Exposure](/Projects/Project%202/)
3. [Super Peach Sisters](https://github.com/namanmodani/SuperPeachSisters)
4. [Unhinged](https://github.com/namanmodani/Unhinged)
