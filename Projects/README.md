# Projects

CS 32's winter 2022 iteration comprised of four projects. Since the last two projects were fairly large and challenging, I decided to break off my monorepo approach for the class. In the interest of cleaner divison and independent scaling, the code for project 3 can be found [here](https://github.com/namanmodani/SuperPeachSisters), and the code for project 4 can be found [here](https://github.com/namanmodani/Unhinged).
