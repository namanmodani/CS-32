# Projects

CS 32's winter 2022 iteration comprised of four projects. The last two projects being fairly large resulted in my decision to break off my monorepo-style approach for this class. In the interest of clean divison and independent scaling, the code for project 3 can be found [here](https://github.com/namanmodani/SuperPeachSisters), while the code for project 4 can be found [here](https://github.com/namanmodani/Unhinged).
